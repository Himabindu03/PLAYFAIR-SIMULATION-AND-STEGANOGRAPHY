# PLAYFAIR-SIMULATION-AND-STEGANOGRAPHY

Abstract:

In modern communication systems, ensuring data privacy and confidentialityisextremely important. This project focuses on implementing two different securitytechniques—Playfair Cipher for text encryption and LSB (Least Significant Bit)steganography for image encryption—to provide a dual layer of securityforbothtextual and visual data. The Playfair Cipher, a classical symmetric keyencryptionmethod, encrypts text in letter pairs and adds complexity over simple substitutionciphers. Separately, the project uses LSB steganography to hide a messageor anotherimage inside a cover image, making the hidden data undetectable to humaneyes. Byimplementing both techniques independently, this project demonstratestheeffectiveness of classical cryptography for textual data and digital steganographyforimage-based data. This approach helps learners understand and apply bothsecuritytechniques and shows how they can be used to protect different types of information.

Introduction:


As digital communication continues to grow, so does the need toprotect bothtextual and image data from unauthorized access. Attackers often target sensitivetextand images shared over networks, which can lead to data breaches andmisuseofpersonal or confidential information. To address these concerns, various techniqueshave been developed in the field of information security.This project implementstwoseparate techniques to secure text and image data:

1. Text Encryption using Playfair Cipher
2. Image Encryption using Steganography (LSB Method)


Tools Used to Implement Project:
1. Software Tools :
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Web Browser
Code Editor
Operating System
2. Hardware Tools :
 Laptop/Desktop
 Display Monitor
 Mouse & Keyboard
 Storage



Conclusion:


In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates the use of cryptographictechniques to secure both text and image data. The Playfair Cipher was usedfortextencryption, converting the message into digraphs and applying a set of rules toencryptit. This method ensures that the text remains secure and difficult to decode without thecorrect key. For image encryption, the project allows the user to upload an image, provideakey,and encrypt it. The image is modified at the pixel level using the key, andit canonlybe decrypted back to its original form with the same key. If the keyis incorrect,decryption is not possible, ensuring the security of the image. The entire project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it fullyclient-side and easily accessible through a web browser. This approach demonstrateshowdifferent encryption techniques can be applied to both text and images, offeringasimple yet secure way to protect data
